Three poems on liberty, chaos, and solitude. 

*Poem 1*

To the forgotten fruit  
Of times immemorial  
To the blood red mulberry  
the lunar currant
the vermiculated gooseberry  
Whose drops of sour nectar  
Drip and dry  
In the summer air  
Whose aroma of solitude  
Desiccates the mourning  
For a sweet night  

*Poem 2*
  
Oderr tou  
of oachs  
atuyBe  
fo soCha  
uBeaty out   
Order uto  
of socha    
Beauty tou of Order    
Order 
out of Chaos;  
Beauty 
out of  
Order


*Poem 3*

Give me liberty  
Or give me life  
Whose river  
Knows no tributaries  
But sheer force of will  
And serendipitous  
Serenity
