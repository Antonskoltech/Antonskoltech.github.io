title: Liberty, Chaos and Solitude
---

Three poems on liberty, chaos, and solitude. Long live them all.

*Poem 1*

To the forgotten fruit  
Of times immemorial  
To the blood red mulberry  
the lunar currant  
the vermiculated gooseberry  
Whose drops of sour nectar  
Drip and dry  
In the summer air  
Whose aroma of solitude  
Desiccates the mourning  
For a sweet night  

*Poem 2*

Chaos of

Beauty out  
of Chaos  

*Poem 3*

Give me liberty  
Or give me life  
Whose river  
Knows no tributaries  
But sheer force of will  
And serendipitous  
Serenity
