Three short poems:

*Poem 1*

In howling storms
In silent meadows
In dawn perennial with its dusk 
And sun eternal in its firmament
In darkness and in light
there lies my love for you
my shade, my warmth
my strength and sorrow

*Poem 2*

The tender night
Lulls my restless mind
And thoughts of you
Ooze like honey
Sweetening every dream

*Poem 3*

What is the flower?
Without the frost
An everlasting symbol
Signifying nothing

Meaningless, utterly meaningless
We are eternally good
You whisper
The great unknown
Awaits

I stand still
Petrified and frozen
What is the winter?
Without the bud that drives through
The thawed earth
In March

I love you still
In winter and in spring
