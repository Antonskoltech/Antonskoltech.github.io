title: Three Short Poems

*Poem 1*

In howling storms  
And silent meadows  
In dawn perennial with its dusk  
And sun eternal in its firmament  
In darkness and in light  
There lies my love for you  
My shade, my warmth  
My strength and sorrow  

*Poem 2*

You ooze like honey  
in the evening light  
Seeping into every crevice    
of my saccharine mind  

The eastern rays  
dissolve your sickly shadow  
And flood my veins  
with the world unseen

*Poem 3*

What is the flower?    
Without the frost    
An everlasting symbol      
Signifying nothing  

Meaningless  
Utterly meaningless!  
We are eternally good (you whisper)  
Yet great awaits

What is the winter?  
Without the bud  
A frozen vanity  
Rife with matter    
yet numb to glory  

Beyond the western rim  
Where spring begins  
Yet winter chills  
I love you still (I whisper)
