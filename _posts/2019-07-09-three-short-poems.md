Three short poems:

*Poem 1*

In howling storms  
In silent meadows  
In dawn perennial with its dusk  
And sun eternal in its firmament  
In darkness and in light  
there lies my love for you  
my shade, my warmth  
my strength and sorrow  

*Poem 2*

You ooze like honey  
in the evening light  
Seeping into every crevace    
of my saccharine mind  

The eastern rays  
dissolve your sickly shadow  
And flood my veins  
with the world unseen


*Poem 3*

What is the flower?  
Without the frost  
An everlasting symbol  
Signifying nothing 

Meaningless, utterly meaningless  
We are eternally good  
You whisper  
The great unknown  
Awaits

I stand still  
Petrified and frozen  
What is the winter?  
Without the bud that drives through  
The thawed earth  
In March 

I love you still  
In winter and in spring
