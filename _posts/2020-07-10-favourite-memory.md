A short poem. 

*To my favourite memory (lovely, beyond)*

To my favourite memory (lovely, beyond),  
your eyes open on the pillow (moist, mahogany)  
in the morning song (tender, embrace)  
fill the ocean I crossed (a moth, a flame)  
with the word that begat the world (encourage, mint) and became its destroyer (odi, amo).  

To my Alabama (to my key lime pie),  
lovely, beyond.
