*Poem 1*

Dance aurora, dance!  
Melt the corporeal amber  
And burn the cardiatric kindling  
To turn the aged wax  
Into forms anew  

Engulf the petrified abyss  
With light and shadow  
Make haste!  
The dawn is near 

*Poem 2*

You ooze like honey  
in the evening light  
Seeping into every crevice  
of my saccharine mind

The eastern rays  
dissolve your sickly shadow   
And flood my veins  
with the world unseen
