*Poem 1*

Dance aurora, dance!  
Melt the corporeal amber  
And burn the cardiatric kindling  
To turn the aged wax  
Into forms anew  

Engulf the petrified abyss  
With light and shadow  
Make haste!  
The dawn is near 

*Poem 2*

The augusta gorge  
Weaves its way through  
Painted corners and  
Forgotten flora  
The musk and dirt and chaos  
beat with the fervour  
Of lives unsullied  
And life set free
