Welcome to valentinp.com! This is the homepage of yours truly, Valentin Peretroukhin. I am a graduate student at the [University of Toronto](http://utoronto.ca).

### How this website is built
If you're curious how this website is built. Here is a synopsis of all the tools I used:

* Jekyll, with Poole foundation
* Hyde theme (with a few modifications)
* Kuler Neutral Blue color theme
* Font Awesome for all the icons
* Github pages for hosting

This is a fantastic (and totally free!) solution for a simple personal website. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to something like WordPress or SquareSpace.
