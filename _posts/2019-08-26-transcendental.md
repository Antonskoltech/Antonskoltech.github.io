Three poems with titles.

*Luna*

Oh, moon  
Whose light is   
Not of your dominion  
Oh, moon  
Whose light is  
Soft and shy  
Oh, moon  
Whose craters   
Tell of distant chaos   
Oh, moon  
Reveal your obverse,  
Light the darkness  
And flood the earth!
 

*Transcendental*

Numbers  
Vast and dense  
Spread the line  
Whose markings  
Tell of simpler times  
Where finitude   
Was King  
And the transcendental  
Was the Joker  
Who cast a shadow  
On the soul

*Unafraid*

The final Horseman  
Leaves a pale wake  
That blinds and shatters.  
Yet I am Man  
Who domesticates the Wildebeests,  
Declaws the Lions,  
And eats the tender flesh of Youth.  
I fear You not;  
Roam free,   
And find me when You will.
