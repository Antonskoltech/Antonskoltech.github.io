*Mountains*

The mountains wait for sin  
A Sun rises in the east  
bearing fruit and wine and glory  
The mountains scoff  
Sun, you terrible pest  

The days come and go  
The rivers flow  
The grasses flower  
The village invades  

The mountains sulk  
Sun, you terrible pest  
You bring these fools  
This flesh and flora  
Sun, you terrible pest!  
The mountains cry  

The Sun is patient  
The Sun is kind  
And when the mountains sleep  
The Sun also riseth

*Heart*
  
My heart  
and blisters  
My head  
and whispers  

The blood and thought of wolf and lamb  
In holy mountains, spread like dawn  
Amongst the grey of fallen flesh  
  
My heart  
and grace  
My head  
and space

*Void*

No words to write  
No darkness to light  

No death to mourn  
No lovers to scorn  

No snake and no dove  
No hate and no love  

No sound and no fury  
No judge and no jury  

No pity and no spite  
No may and no might
