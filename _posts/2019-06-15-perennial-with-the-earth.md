A short poem:

My love for You  
shields the howling storm   
and warms the silent meadow  
Perennial with the dawn and dusk and firmament  
You are my sun, my shade, my fire  
Until the howl and silence are one the same;  
until we meet  
our Maker,  
join me, my love, to chase the wind  
For when we find the pale horse,
We will stand together;  
Together, unafraid.
