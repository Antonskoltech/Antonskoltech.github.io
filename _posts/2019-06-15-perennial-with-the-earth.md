A short poem:

My love for You  
pierces the howling wind and  
warms the silent meadow  
Perennial with the dawn and dusk and firmament  
You are my sun, my shade, my fire  
Until the howl and silence are one the same;  
until we meet  
our Maker,  
join me  
and we will find the pale horse  
and stand together, unafraid.
