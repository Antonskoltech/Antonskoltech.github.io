  <h3 align="center">My contribtution</h3>
  <p> I was one of the member of electronics team. I has developed from scratch the control and power supply system of the pneumatic manipulator of a secondary autonomous mobile robot. Additionally, I developed a printed circuit board (PCB) for connecting STM32f4 and STM32f0 microcontrollers and peripherals: maxon motors, dynamixels, proximity sensors and a stepper. All code is available here: <a href="https://github.com/Antonskoltech/eurobot2019"> https://github.com/Antonskoltech/eurobot2019</a>.
