<p>Here are some projects I've been involved with that don't pertain to school or research (woo!).</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="http://diempouch.com">Pillsy / DiemPouch </a></h4>
        <p><em>Diem pouch</em> (originally called <em>Pillsy</em>) is a small company that I founded with my friends Eric, Tony, Sandra and Courtney. We made a smart connected pouch and app that helped people take their medication on time. We won several entrepreneurial awards and got some major press (including Toronto Star and Wired) before discontinuing the project.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="http://neverfromconcentrate.com">Never from Concentrate</a></h4>
        <p><em>Never from Concentrate</em> is a blog and podcast that I started with my friend Rachit. Each month, we pick a topic, write a few letters about it to each other, and then summarize our thoughts in a podcast. Some topics we've covered include vegetarianism, free will and steriods, procrastination and the value of sports to society.</p>

        <p><em>MindCipher</em> is a website I made with my undergraduate room-mates Aakash and Ravi. It is a compendium of different fantastic brain teasers and puzzles, with ratings and comments from registered users.</p>
