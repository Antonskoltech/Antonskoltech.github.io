#### Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Driving 
*Fall 2020*  
The course is part of the Computer Science division at the Innopolis University. It is designed for the senior students and a covers an array of topics in mobile robotics kinematics, perception-SLAM, and planning of trajectory. I taught and prepared homework for perception-SLAM section of the course, which includes particle filter, linear and non-linear Kalman filters, and proctored the final exam (9 students). As a results of this course, students gained interest to applied their knowledge to the development of localization for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGB2NR8qpKY&t">self-driving vehicles</a> for the Russian car industry.

#### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
*Spring 2021*  
The course is part of the Computer Science division at the Innopolis University. It is designed for the sophomore students (~50 students) and provide a diverse theoretical overview of historical and current thought in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, Robotics and Machine Learning Techniques. I taught and prepared homework for Searching and Optimization tasks, Tree Searching and logic, including basics of PROLOG as a language for answering such problems, Evolutionary Algorithms. As a results of this course, students gained interest to applied their basic knowledge and got and ability to create their own AI system for real-world application.
