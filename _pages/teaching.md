#### AER521: Mobile Robotics and Perception
*Winter 2018*   
I co-taught a fourth year / graduate-level course on mobile autonomy and perception with my colleague Lee Clement. The course covered the basics of mobile autonomy, including batch and recursive state estimation, motion models, planning algorithms, state-space control, and the basics of machine learning.

#### Coursera Specialization on Self-Driving Cars  
*Summer 2018*  
I was one of two subject-matter experts (SMEs) who developed the State Estimation course (Course 2) of the [Coursera self-driving car specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars). This specialization was developed in a partnership between Coursera, University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo.

#### ESC103: Engineering Mathematics and Computation  
*Fall 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018*  
ESC103 is a first year course in the Engineering Science division at the University of Toronto. It covers an array of topics in linear algebra, numerical computing and differential equations. I have taught two sections of students (typically 20 - 25 students each) for the last five years. In 2016, I was also the lab coordinator for the MATLAB section of the course.

#### Engineering Problem Solving and Mathematics
*Summer 2017*   
I co-organized a week-long summer preparatory course for incoming first year engineering students. I taught two sessions of introductory MATLAB lessons, and then designed and implemented an RC-circuit laboratory that the students completed at the end of the course.

#### CSC190: Computer Algorithms and Data Structures  
*Winter 2015*   
CSC190 is the second introductory computer science course taught to first year Engineering Science students. I had the pleasure of being a lab and marking TA during the winter of 2015. I taught fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.
