*Fall 2020*  
The course is part of the Computer Science division at the Innopolis University. It is designed for the fourth year undegraduate students and a covers an array of topics in mobile robotics kinematics, perception-SLAM, and planning of trajectory. I taught and prepared homework for perception-SLAM section of the course (Particle Filter, linear and Non linear Kalman Filters)(typically 9 students). As a results of this course, students gained interest and applied their knowledge to the development of localization of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGB2NR8qpKY&t">self-driving vehicles</a>for Russian car industry.
