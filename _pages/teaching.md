#### Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Driving 
*Fall 2020*  
This is a second year course in the Computer Science division at the Innopolis University. It covers an array of topics in mobile robot kinematics, perception-SLAM and planning for mobile robotcs. I have taught and prepared homework for one section (Particle Filter, linear and Non linear Kalman Filters) of students (typically 9 students).
