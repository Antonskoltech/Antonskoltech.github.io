        <p><strong>Oct 2018 – Jun 2019</strong>: Eurobot is a robotic constest. An amazing event gathering fun, high technology, friendship, creativity, education and passion!
        Created in 1998, Eurobot is an international amateur robotics contest open to teams of young people, organized either in student projects or in independent clubs.</p>

        <p> To participate in the competition the team needs to design and make two autonomous robots.
        The robots must complete specific tasks in a minute and 30 seconds and earn maximum points.
        At the same time the team must solve a number of specific tasks and to complete a full cycle of development and production of the robot.
