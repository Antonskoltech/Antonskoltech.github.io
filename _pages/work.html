        <p>Eurobot is a robotic constest. An amazing event gathering fun, high technology, friendship, creativity, education and passion!
        Created in 1998, Eurobot is an international amateur robotics contest open to teams of young people, organized either in student projects or in independent clubs.</p>

        <p> To participate in the competition the team needs to design and make two autonomous robots.
        The robots must complete specific tasks in a minute and 30 seconds and earn maximum points.
        At the same time the team must solve a number of specific tasks and to complete a full cycle of development and production of the robot.

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="sample-work/"> Development of hardware system and motion planning analysis for a Quadruped mobile robot</a></h4>
        <p>Nowadays, there are few unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are capable of landing on uneven surfaces or moving on the complex ground. A drone having both of these functionalities can significantly improve its performance in accomplishing difficult tasks, such as monitoring and exploring various types of terrain, searching for survivors, and delivering medical aid or repair kits in an unstructured dynamic environment, e.g., rescue operation following an earthquake..</p>
