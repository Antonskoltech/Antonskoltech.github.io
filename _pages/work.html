        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="">Robust 3D Mapping and Localization algorithms for self-driving vehicle and truck </a></h4>
        <p><strong>Nov. 2020 – Jun. 2021 </strong>: I was a Research Engineer in SLAM team in Innopolis University, Russia. I have been working on Visual road signs tracking, 3D Segmentation and Object Detection and building full HD map with static objects for self-driving car localization. Also, my task includes creating of robust LiDAR odometry algorithm to build 3D Map and localization. </p>

        <p><strong>Jun. 2021 – Mar. 2021 </strong>: I was a Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group at OZON Technology (Russia). I was responsible for the development of odometry/localization/3D mapping algorithms for autonomous truck. Also, I did a sensor calibrations (LiDAR - LiDAR extrinsics). </p>

        <p><strong>Oct. 2018 – Jun. 2019</strong>: Eurobot is a robotics constest. An amazing event gathering fun, high technology, friendship, creativity, education and passion!
        Created in 1998, Eurobot is an international amateur robotics contest open to teams of young people, organized either in student projects or in independent clubs.</p>

        <p> To participate in the competition the team needs to design and make two autonomous robots.
        The robots must complete specific tasks in a minute and 30 seconds and earn maximum points.
        At the same time the team must solve a number of specific tasks and to complete a full cycle of development and production of the robot.

          <strong>Research topic:</strong> 
          <br>
          Optimizing buried junction cubic π-SnS photocathodes for water splitting (using AA-CVD, Magnetron sputtering, XRD, PEC and SEM analysis)-the goal is to fabricate a solar water splitting device that produces hydrogen.</p>
          -Fabricated a series of 2% Zn doped π-SnS coated with different buffer layers consisting CdS, Zn(O,S), MoS$$_{2}$$, or Ag$_{5}$SnS$_{6}$ of which the former two were coated with a 50nm layer of TiO$_{2}$, since electrochemically unstable
          <br>
          -Investigated the photoelectrochemical properties a series of $\pi\normalsize$-SnS devices
