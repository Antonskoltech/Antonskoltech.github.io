Hello! My name is Anton. I'm a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in the fusion of learned and classical techniques for robust perception.

I am currently a research assistant at the[Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) with [*Prof. Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

<!-- I am a fan of philosophy, aviation, sport, food, and art. In particular, the work of Arthur Schopenhauer, William Blake, Simone Weil, Leonard Cohen, Cormac McCarthy, Bon Iver, Charlie Kaufman, Wintersleep, and Dylan Thomas.  -->

My Master's research work was based in the [Biorobotics lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University) under supervision of [*Prof. Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en). Performed research work related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm, which can achieve orientation-invariant 3D place recognition

          <img src='/assets/img/projects/spherevlad_framework.jpg' class='project-img'>
          <p>SeqSphereVLAD is a deep learing approach to achieving accurate, robust 3D Place recognition (use to build large scale 3D map) using point-clouds (3D Lidar data) based on a viewpoint-invariant descriptor.  This work was accepted for publication in the  <a href="https://www.iros2020.org/index.html"> International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS2020)</a>, Las Vegas, NV, USA, 2020

<strong> January, 2019 </strong> - Pilot School from Boeing center in Russia (as the Independent Studies Period at my Skoltech university): taking to the skies. For several weeks I racked up dozens of hours behind a flight simulator, in hopes rising among the high-scoring few that would finish the term behind a real flight deck, preparing for takeoff.
