  Hey there! 
</p>

<img src='/assets/vp.png' style='float:left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0' />

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/">STARS </a> (Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems) Lab at the University of Toronto's Institute for Aerospace Studies.
I received my B.A.Sc also from the University of Toronto in Engineering Science (N&Psi;) majoring in Aerospace.


My current research focuses on autonomous navigation within dynamic environments. I am working with <a href="http://www.jonathankelly.info">Professor Jonathan Kelly</a> on
a predictive filtering approach that uses a learned model for both the process and observation noise covariance to improve the performance of
visual inertial odometry techniques within highly dynamic, urban environments.
