<h3>Work</h3>

<li><a href="http://mindcipher.com">Mindcipher.com</a> <br/>
	Mindcipher is a social puzzle and brain teaser website that I made together with two of my roommates, Ravi Trivedi and Aakash Sahney
	in undergrad. It has everything from quick, short one-liners to difficult logic puzzles and everything in between.

<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valper.easycyrillic&hl=en">EasyCyrillic</a><br/>
EasyCyrillic is a simple Android app that I made while learning the platform. If you ever need to type something in Cyrillic letters but don't want
to switch keyboards, this is a useful little tool.
